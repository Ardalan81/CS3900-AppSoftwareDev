# Database Design - Group Project Additions

## Purpose / Objectives

- Defining API endpoints
- Defining method taskings at layers - Controller, Service, Repository, DTO, and Model
- Building GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE Mappings for endpoints
- Testing API endpoints with tool (Swagger)

## Description

If you have not already, join your group's GitHub repository and clone the repository to your system.

Check that you can build and connect to your group project database and have a current copy of any revisions made using the feedback from the DB team.

Revisit your team's proposed wireframes and apply feedback from the UIUX team.  The wireframes will provide foundation for your project's endpoints.

Through the microservices unit, you have been detangling layers & mappings for endpoints.  The group project will have you defining and implementing endpoints for your group project.

Since each team member built a wireframe, I recommend having the same team member who built the wireframe take lead in building the endpoint.

This is where repository management is going to come in clutch. Some methods for approach:
> [!TIP]
> Keep having team mates use the assignment-7 repository to build and test only their endpoint.  Merge the "final" endpoint code with the group project repository once built and tested.

> [!TIP] 
> Have team members build their endpoints on different branches.  Name the branch with the corresponding endpoint.  Merge branches with `main` once branch endpoint is built and tested.

> [!CAUTION]
> Everyone work on the `main` branch.  This will end in disaster and tears because to run your project your team members stuff needs to not be broken (and vice versa).  Good luck, don't forget to `pull`.
