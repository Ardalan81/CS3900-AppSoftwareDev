# [Unit Name] Project Requirements

As each unit introduce content and concepts, students will be working on their group project to make progress per unit expectations.  The group project is lightly iterative, so some teams may meet updated requirements perfectly, others may need feedback and another iteration.  There will be an additional rubirc with all project components for the group project as a whole.  This will reiterate unit requirements and may tie together units that have dependencies that need more knowledge.

The unit project requirements are due 1 week **after** the unit is complete.
