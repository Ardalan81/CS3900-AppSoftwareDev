# DevOps (Development Operations)

DevOps will be teaching three units during this course that will weave in before they are applied in a module.  

1. How to use containers as a development environment
2. How to use GitHub Actions and cloud services (pipelines)
3. Automating testing during the development process

Each will have an individual assignment to apply the topic and build your understanding.

The elements required in the group project will be contained in the module that applies them.  For example, your group project will use a container for the database - that deliverable will be due alongside the database.
