# Testing - Assignment 2 - Service Tests

Create Service classes MockitoJunit test cases.

## Purpose / Objectives

- Understanding of uses for ExtendWith & MockitoExtension for registering Test Service class.  
- Understanding of Mock & Spy annotations for declaring Spring Context bean class.  
- Understanding of BeforeEach, & Test annotations for method declaration and its executions.  
- Understanding of handling all possible test cases for service class methods.

## Assignment Description

* Create CustomerServiceTest class for CustomerService and add all test methods for save, update & get methods. Make sure all JUnit test cases should pass.  
  * save method \- cover JUnit test cases for success and failure cases (when exception occurs).  
  * update method \- cover JUnit test cases for success, failure cases (when exception occurs, customer id not found).  
  * get method \- cover JUnit test cases for success, failure cases (when exception occurs),  data not found based on given criteria. And verify the response when data is returned without any exceptions.  
* Continue WorkOrderServiceTest class remaining methods test cases. Make sure all JUnit test cases should pass.  
  * saveLineItem method \- cover JUnit test cases for success and failure cases (when exception occurs, workOrder id not found).  
  * get method \- cover JUnit test cases for success, failure cases (when exception occurs),  data not found based on given criteria. And verify the response when data is returned without any exceptions.  
* Fixes in StateServiceTest class for state get method. Make sure all JUnit test cases should pass.  
  * Fix test cases for the get method to confirm itâ€™s handling success and failure cases (when exception occurs), data not found. And verify the returned data when there is no exception.  
    

## Deliverable

* Push CustomerServiceTest class into the Github repository.  
* Push new JUnit test cases for WorkOrder service class methods into the Github repository.  
* Push fixes of StateServiceTest class into the Github repository.
