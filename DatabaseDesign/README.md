# Database Design

In an attempt to make it "seamless" to share information with students and to make the option of modifying resources at anytime 
possible, it will be best for teams to add their content to this shared GitHub.  Students will be linked to this GitHub repository 
from Pilot (the learning management system) rather than have a queue of things that need updated / synchronized.

1. Create a module folder in this repository for content, assignments, and project requirements
2. Create wither a singular README.md OR multiple files named background.md, content.md, assignment.md, project.md, etc.

# Background

Before we begin this unit, you need to read / watch the following videos / articles.

You will need to understand these key takeaways:
- thing 1
- thing 2
- thing 3

# Content

Key points you will be presenting in class, any internet resources to share as companions.

Powerpoint (or other slide deck tools):
1. Export the slide deck to PDF
2. Add the PDF to the module folder

# Assigments

Uniquely named `.md` files within the module folder.  The intent is that assignments are generally begun in class and due the following class period (unless more time is needed)

# Project Requirements

Uniquely named `.md` files within the module folder.  The group project should have new requirements within each module based on lessons learned from the in-class work.
