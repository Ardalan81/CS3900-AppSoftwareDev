# Database Design - Group Project Additions

## Purpose / Objectives

TODO

## Deliverable(s)

The group repository needs to include the following:
- db-models.md containing:
    - description / justification of presented models
    - conceptual model
    - logical model
    - physical model (TODO: how to effectively export / represent?)
- Dockerfile that uses MariaDB for database & initializes it using script
- MariaDB initialization script
    - script is modified to initialize the group database OR set of SQL commands is written in `db-models.md`
- Export / backup of database

## Rubric

Score: # of out TODO points

Group contribution scores are calculated by number of members who contributed over number of group members.  This will be denoted by the following formula where $c$ is members who contributed and $m$ is number of group members:

$$ c \over m $$

- Each group member made a contribution to the TODO, as reflected in commit history. $c \over m$
