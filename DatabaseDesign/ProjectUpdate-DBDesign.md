# Database Design - Group Project Additions

## Purpose / Objectives

- Conceptual, Logical, & Physical Database Models for group project
- Initialize MariaDB container environment for group project
- Build physical database in container environment for group project
- Write basic queries to validate database configuration for group database

## Description

If you have not already, join your group's GitHub repository and clone the repository to your system.

Through the DB Design unit, you have been given assignments to individual present your understanding of the different models and database tools.  The group project component will focus on collecting these to one group-agreed-on decision and collection to build on going forward.

In your Group Project repository, create a folder named `DB`.

Use a computer-based visualization tool to upload your group project models for:
- Conceptual Model
- Logical Model
- Physical Model

These models should flow in agreement with eachother.




## Deliverable(s)

The group repository needs to include the following:
- db-models.md containing:
    - Conceptual Model
    - Logical Model
    - Physical Model
    - Description / Justification of presented models
- Dockerfile that uses MariaDB for database & creates it using MariaDB initialization script
- MariaDB initialization script
    - Script is modified to create the group database OR set of SQL commands is written in `db-models.md`

## Submission

Submit link to assignment repository in the Dropbox in Pilot.  Only ONE team member needs to remember to submit the link.

URL looks like: https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/cs3900-YOURGROUPNAME

## Rubric

Score: # out of TODO points

Since there has been in class discussion time to build each model and agree to the foundations as a group, who commits the collection of models and other required elements will not be tracked.
