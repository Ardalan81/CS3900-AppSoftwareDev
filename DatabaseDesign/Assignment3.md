# Database Design - Assignment 3 - Physical Model

## Purpose / Objectives

- Apply knowledge / concepts from pre-requisite videos
- Understand purpose and audience of the physical model
- Create a physical model of your group project theme
- Improve your physical model via peer-review critiques
	- Review will be done in following class session

## Description

The intent is to learn about physical models and build one using your group projectâ€™s theme.

1. Clone the assignment repository
2. Watch the required videos (TODO: post link to video set)
3. Write a description of the following components:
	- Key difference of the physical model compared to the conceptual and logical models
	- What are the basic data types
	- Default values / Null values
	- Check constraints
	- Database Security
4. Create a physical model for your group project theme
5. Describe your physical model.  

In the next class session your physical model will undergo peer review.  You will use their feedback to improve your physical model ahead of the next assignment.

## Deliverable(s)

Submit to the assignment repository on GitHub.  Your README must include:

- Your updated physical diagram
- Describe each of the following components:
	- Key difference of the physical model compared to the conceptual and logical models
	- What are the basic data types
	- Default values / Null values
	- Check constraints
	- Database Security
- Description of presented physical model
- Physical model diagram using group project theme
