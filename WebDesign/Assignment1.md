# Assignment 1: Web Design - Styling & Directives

## Purpose / Objectives  
- Set up the Angular development environment.
- Create a basic structure and styling for a homepage.
- Utilize directives to enhance interactivity.

## Description  

For this assignment set, you may pick a theme of your choice.  It is strongly recommend to pick your group project so that you can have different designs and feedback to pull from when the module finishes and the group project requirements from this module are fleshed out.

1. **Accept and clone the Web Design Assignment Repository** in Pilot.
    - The repository will be **empty**
    - Complete the assignment instructions in your cloned repository

2. **Verify Setup and Create New Project**  
   - Ensure Angular CLI, Node.js, and IDE (preferably IntelliJ) are installed.
   - Create a new Angular project that you will be using for this and following assignments.

3. **Create a Homepage Template**  
   - Create a homepage template as a base, adding TODOs for future features you want to add in later on.

4. **Add Directives**  
   - Use at least one structural directive (e.g., `*ngIf` for conditional rendering or `*ngFor` for looping over a list).
   - Use at least one attribute directive (e.g., `ngClass` or `ngStyle`) to dynamically style elements based on component data.

5. **Apply Styling**  
   - Use basic CSS or Angular's style binding to give the homepage a polished look.
   - Implement at least one layout using Flexbox or CSS Grid (e.g., aligning a navbar or centering content on the homepage).

6. **Set Up a Navigation Bar**  
   - Create a static navbar with placeholder links (these will be functional in the next assignment).
   - Apply responsive styling to make the navbar adapt to smaller screens.

7. **Bonus**  
   - Add a small interactive feature using data binding, such as a button that toggles the visibility of additional information on the homepage.
