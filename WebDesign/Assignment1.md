# Assignment 1: Web Design - Styling & Directives

## Purpose / Objectives  
- Set up the Angular development environment.
- Create a basic structure and styling for a homepage.
- Utilize directives to enhance interactivity.

## Description  
1. **Verify Setup and Create New Project**  
   - Ensure Angular CLI, Node.js, and IDE (preferably IntelliJ) are installed.
   - Create a new Angular project that you will be using for this and following assignments.

2. **Create a Homepage Template**  
   - Create a homepage template as a base, adding TODOs for future features you want to add in later on.

3. **Add Directives**  
   - Use at least one structural directive (e.g., `*ngIf` for conditional rendering or `*ngFor` for looping over a list).
   - Use at least one attribute directive (e.g., `ngClass` or `ngStyle`) to dynamically style elements based on component data.

4. **Apply Styling**  
   - Use basic CSS or Angular's style binding to give the homepage a polished look.
   - Implement at least one layout using Flexbox or CSS Grid (e.g., aligning a navbar or centering content on the homepage).

5. **Set Up a Navigation Bar**  
   - Create a static navbar with placeholder links (these will be functional in the next assignment).
   - Apply responsive styling to make the navbar adapt to smaller screens.

6. **Bonus**  
   - Add a small interactive feature using data binding, such as a button that toggles the visibility of additional information on the homepage.

**Deliverable**  
- Push your edits to the assignment repository.
