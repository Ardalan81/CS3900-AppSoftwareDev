   - **Setup Files After Env:** `'<rootDir>/setup-jest.ts'`
   - **Other Options:** Configure as per project needs (e.g., choosing to collect coverage, setting the test environment to `jsdom`, etc.).

   **Generated `jest.config.js`:**

   ```javascript
   // jest.config.js
   module.exports = {
     preset: 'jest-preset-angular',
     setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/setup-jest.ts'],
     testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
     transform: {
       '^.+\\.(ts|js|html)$': 'ts-jest',
     },
     moduleNameMapper: {
       '^src/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1',
     },
     globals: {
       'ts-jest': {
         tsconfig: '<rootDir>/tsconfig.spec.json',
         stringifyContentPathRegex: '\\.html$',
       },
     },
     coverageReporters: ['html', 'lcov', 'text-summary'],
   };
   ```

6. **Update `tsconfig.spec.json` File:**

   Configures TypeScript for Jest testing.

   ```json
   // tsconfig.spec.json
   {
     "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
     "compilerOptions": {
       "outDir": "./out-tsc/spec",
       "types": [
         "jest"
       ],
       "esModuleInterop": true,
       "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
     },
     "include": [
       "src/**/*.spec.ts",
       "src/**/*.d.ts"
     ]
   }
   ```

7. **Add Jest Scripts to `package.json`:**

   Replaces existing test scripts with Jest-compatible scripts.

   ```json
   // package.json (Excerpt)
   {
     "scripts": {
       // ... other scripts
       "test": "jest --verbose",
       "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
       "test:watch": "jest --watch",
       "test:ci": "jest --ci --coverage"
     }
   }
   ```

8. **Write Unit Test Cases with Jest Syntax:**

   Develops tests using Jest's syntax, leveraging its features for efficient testing.

   ```typescript
   // contact.component.spec.ts
   import { ComponentFixture, TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
   import { ContactComponent } from './contact.component';
   import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

   describe('ContactComponent', () => {
     let component: ContactComponent;
     let fixture: ComponentFixture<ContactComponent>;

     beforeEach(async () => {
       await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
         declarations: [ ContactComponent ],
         imports: [ ReactiveFormsModule ]
       })
       .compileComponents();

       fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ContactComponent);
       component = fixture.componentInstance;
       fixture.detectChanges();
     });

     it('should create', () => {
       expect(component).toBeTruthy();
     });

     it('should have invalid form when empty', () => {
       expect(component.contactForm.valid).toBeFalsy();
     });

     it('should validate email field correctly', () => {
       const email = component.contactForm.controls['email'];
       email.setValue('invalid-email');
       expect(email.valid).toBeFalsy();

       email.setValue('valid@example.com');
       expect(email.valid).toBeTruthy();
     });

     // Add more tests to reach at least 80% code coverage
   });
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - **Test Structure:** Uses Jest's `describe`, `it`, and `expect` syntax for organizing and asserting tests.
   - **Component Creation Test:** Ensures that the component is instantiated correctly.
   - **Form Validation Tests:** Verifies that form controls behave as expected, enhancing the reliability of form interactions.
   - **Coverage Goal:** Encourages writing comprehensive tests to achieve high code coverage, ensuring that most of the codebase is tested and reliable.
