# Web Design

### Web Design Concepts

1. **Components and Templates**    
    - Teach the basics of Angular components and how to use templates to define the UI.
    - Emphasize the use of Angular CLI for scaffolding new components.

2. **Data Binding and Directives**    
    - Cover the different types of data binding (interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding).
    - Explain built-in directives (ngIf, ngFor, ngClass, ngStyle) and how to create custom directives.

3. **Services and Dependency Injection**
    - Introduce services and explain how to use them to share data and logic across components.
    - Cover Angular's dependency injection system and how to provide services at different levels (root, component).

4. **Routing and Navigation**
    - Teach how to set up routing in an Angular application, including configuring routes, lazy loading, and route guards.
    - Explain how to navigate between routes programmatically.

5. **Forms and Validation**
    - Cover template-driven and reactive forms.
    - Explain how to implement form validation and display validation messages.

6. **HTTP Client and Observables**
    - Teach how to make HTTP requests using Angular's HttpClient module.
    - Introduce observables from RxJS and how to handle asynchronous data streams.

### Best Practices for Good Design

1. **Component-Based Architecture**
    - Encourage breaking down the UI into reusable, self-contained components.
    - Emphasize the single responsibility principle for components.

2. **State Management**
    - Introduce state management concepts and libraries like NgRx for managing application state.
    - Teach the importance of maintaining a predictable and centralized state.

3. **Separation of Concerns**
    - Promote separating concerns by using services for business logic and components for presentation logic.
    - Encourage the use of shared modules to organize reusable components, directives, and pipes.

4. **Modular Structure**
    - Teach how to structure an Angular application using feature modules and core/shared modules.
    - Explain the benefits of lazy loading and how to implement it to improve performance.

5. **Testing**
    - Cover unit testing for components, services, and pipes using Jasmine and Karma.

6. **Performance Optimization**
    - Discuss techniques for optimizing Angular applications, such as AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation, lazy loading, and ChangeDetectionStrategy.
    - Teach how to use Angular CLI tools for performance analysis and improvement.
