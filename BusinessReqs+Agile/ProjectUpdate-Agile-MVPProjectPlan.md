# Agile Project Planning - Group Project Components

## Purpose / Objectives

- Define an MVP for your group themed project
- Apply agile methods to create a plan for your group themed project

## Description

If you have not already, join your group's GitHub repository and clone the repository to your system.

There are **two** worksheets templated in your group project repository that need to be complete.  The third is an exercise for **honors** students only, although it is recommended to complete it.

Required worksheets:
- `Agile-MVP-BusinessNeedsAnalysis.md`
- `Agile-MVP-CoreFeatures.md`
- `Agile-MVP-Honors-CoreFeatures.md` - **Honors only**

It is recommended to have your group commit to a project planning tool (even if it is simple, like regular use of GitHub Issues) to track tasking in the project and responsibilities of team members.  Recommended tools include, but are not limited to:
- Trello (recommended)
- GitHub Projects / Issues
- Excel
- Chat channel in MSTeams (inform instructor of record to have this created)

## Deliverable(s)

Your group repository needs to include the following:
- `Agile-MVP-BusinessNeedsAnalysis.md` updated to your group project theme's information
- `Agile-MVP-CoreFeatures.md` updated to your group project theme's information
- **Honors only** `Agile-MVP-Honors-CoreFeatures.md` updated to your group project theme's information

## Submission

Submit link to assignment repository in the Dropbox in Pilot.  Only ONE team member needs to remember to submit the link.
