| Use Case(s) | “This is Jay Smith with Jay’s Plumbing Company. How can I help you”. The standard way Jay answers his phone, but these days he might as well change it to “This is Jay Smith with Jay’s Plumbing Company. I’m really sorry, what did I forget this time”?Jay has been a plumber since he started working 20some years ago. After working for several companies Jay started his own company 5 years ago. The first year went great as Jay was the only employee and his large network got him lots of work. So much work he was able to hire 3 other plumbers in year 2\. Since then Jay is spending more time organizing the work than doing plumbing work himself. This transition has been difficult for Jay and he does not enjoy it. When Jay hired his first employee he looked into software applications, but they had so many features he was overwhelmed. He decided to keep track of everything on paper because that was the simple solution. As his business keeps growing this is becoming a bigger challenge, to the point that things are getting missed daily.Every day Jay thinks to himself: “If there was only a simple software application, without all the bells and whistles, I could use to organize the Work Orders. One that will not take an MBA to understand and operate. All I need is an application that allows me to send my people to the right customer, keep track of the work they do, how much to charge, and the status of the work. |
