Read the user interview below and answer the questions on what you would include in your Products Requirements Document

> Q: Can you tell me about the last time you went fishing?

A: For sure! I like to go fishing every weekend during the summer. It is where I relax and unwind after a long work week. I own a small boat and trailer, so I can go to different places. I went this past Saturday to a local lake and caught a bunch of different fish

> Q: That sounds exciting! Do you take any technology with you on your fishing trips?

A: Yes, I always have my iPhone with me. I use it to take pictures of what I catch

> Q: You must have a lot of pictures if you go fishing every weekend during the summer. Do you share these with other people? 

A: For Sure

> Q: Is there anything else you share or just the pictures

A: Lots of things. We are kind a nerdy when it comes to the fish we catch. I like to share where I am fishing, and when I catch something I like to share the type of fish I caught, the length, weight, bate used, and of course the picture!
 
> Q: What do you do when you donâ€™t know what type of fish you caught?

A: That never happens. I have been fishing for so long, and by where I go I know what I can catch there. Back when I was a beginner I used just to take a picture and ask one of my older friends after getting back. They would always be able to tell me what it was.
