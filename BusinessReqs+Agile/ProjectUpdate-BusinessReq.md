# Business Requirements - Group Project Additions

## Purpose / Objectives

- Ability to conduct interview to uncover customer / user needs / pain points / frustrations
- Ability to generate product requirements from interviews

## Description

If you have not already, join your group's GitHub repository and clone the repository to your system.  Your contributions to components required will be tracked via commits to your group's repository.

Come up with a themed topic for your group project that encompasses: 
1. TODO
2. TODO
3. TODO

Create a set of user interview questions, three per team member, to flesh out base needs and capabilities of the group's application.

Conduct in-person user interviews using the full set of interview questions and record it via video or transcription.  Each group member must conduct an interview and submit the recording or transcription to the group repository.  Interviews can be conducted on your group members or someone external to your group or the class.  

Build a set of Product Requirements for your group project that addresses learnings from the user interviews and considers the following elements of a Product Requirements Outline:
- Context
- Use Case(s)
- Objective
- Assumptions
- Requirements
- Scope
- Performance
- Open questions

## Deliverable(s)

The group repository needs to include the follow documents:
- interview-questions.md with the group's set of interview questions
- interview-[name].md where name is the name of the person interviewed and contains a transcription or link to video file of the interview.
- product-requirements.md with the group's product requirement outline

## Rubric

Score: # of out 11 points

Group contribution scores are calculated by number of members who contributed over number of group members.  This will be denoted by the following formula where $c$ is members who contributed and $m$ is number of group members:

$$ c \over m $$

- Each group member made a contribution to the interview questions file, as reflected in commit history. $c \over m$
- Each group member submitted an interview transcript or video file. $c \over m$
- Product Requirements Document addresses each point sufficiently: (1 pt per topic)
  - Context
  - Use Case(s)
  - Objective
  - Assumptions
  - Requirements
  - Scope
  - Performance
  - Open questions
- Each group member made a contribution to the Product Requirement Document, as reflected in commit history. $c \over m$
