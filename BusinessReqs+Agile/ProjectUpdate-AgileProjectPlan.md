# Agile Planning - Group Project Additions

## Purpose / Objectives

- Apply agile methods to create a plan for your group themed project

## Description

Define an MVP for your group themed project.

For your group themed topic, generate a project outline of work that needs to be accomplished to create a fully functioning application.  Pick a tool that you and your group members find productive (even if it requires a small learning curve).  

Tool options TODO - check for easy tools integration / limits / capabilities:
- Trello (recommended)
- GitHub Projects / Issues
- Excel

Your outline of work must address a minimum of the following:
- define different epics with an initial timeline on each epic
  - Note: keep in mind that timeline **is the timeline of the class**
- add a business case to each epic
- assign two / three user stories to each epic
- define one spike

## Deliverable(s)

Your group repository need to include the following:
- mvp.md with your MVP defined
- TODO on tool to generate project outline of work either uploaded to repo and / or add Winsupply with appropriate permissions (minimum of view)

## Rubric

- MVP addresses:
  - understanding what the user is going to have as a deliverable (goal), but stays at elevator pitch level
  - defines minumin set of expectations
  - is accomplishable in the defined period of time (based on epics)
  - perspective is of the user and is not technically dense
  - customer value is defined
- Outline of work addresses:
  - different epics defined with an initial timeline on each epic
  - business case assigned to each epic
  - two / three user stories assigned to each epic
  - one spike defined
