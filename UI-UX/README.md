# UI / UX

## Unit 1 - User Flows

### Background

Before we begin this unit, you need to read / watch the following videos / articles.

You will need to understand these key takeaways:
1. User Experience Drives Design Decisions: User flows are essential tools that help map the user’s journey through an application. They are designed not just to outline steps but to focus on the user’s needs, motivations, and potential challenges. Your goal is to design intuitive flows that enhance the user experience by simplifying their path to achieving specific goals.

2. Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: User flows serve as a bridge between design and development. While they are primarily used to structure the user interface, they must also be technically feasible. This unit will emphasize the importance of communication and collaboration between UX designers and developers to ensure that the flows are both user-friendly and implementable.

3. Impact on the Product Lifecycle: Thoughtful user flows contribute to more efficient development and fewer roadblocks down the line. A well-designed flow not only enhances the user's experience but also helps streamline the development process, reducing the likelihood of redesign or rework. Understanding this will help you appreciate how early UX decisions influence the overall product success.

## Unit 2 - Wireframes

### Background

Before we begin this unit, you need to read / watch the following videos / articles.

You will need to understand these key takeaways:
1. Wireframes as Blueprints for Design: Wireframes are the foundational visual guides for your application's layout and structure. They are focused on the arrangement of elements on each screen without diving into aesthetics or detailed functionality. You will learn how wireframes serve as the blueprint for the user interface, allowing for easy adjustments and feedback before deeper development begins.

2. Efficiency in Iteration and Feedback: Wireframes are critical for early feedback and iterative design. They allow you to quickly sketch out ideas and receive feedback from stakeholders, users, and developers before investing time in full designs or code. This unit will help you understand how wireframes streamline the design process, enabling rapid changes while still focusing on user needs and interface flow.

3. Collaboration Between Design and Development: Wireframes play a key role in aligning design goals with technical requirements. You will explore how wireframes help facilitate communication between UX designers and developers, ensuring that the visual structure of the product is aligned with the backend functionality, which will reduce miscommunication and development issues down the road.
